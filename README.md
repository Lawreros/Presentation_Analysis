# Presentation_Analysis
The purpose of this program is to analyze the txt files created by Presentation with reguards to the Memory Development Study and
output meaningful behavioral analysis. The study consists of the participant being shown various images (consisting of an object
on one of two backgrounds with an accompanying question, "Do you like the object" or "Is the object alive") and answering the questions
while inside the MRI. Afterward the participant is removed from the MRI and tested on what they remember about the images.
Both sections produce txt files, which this program analyzes.

I have provided sample data in the "Sample Data" folder.
